Natural acceptance is the process to understand ourselves first. Natural acceptance implies unconditional and total acceptance of the self, people, and environment. It is a way to accept the good things naturally. In other words, human psychology is a person's assent to the reality of a situation, recognizing a process or condition without attempting to change it or protest it. It also refers to the absence of exceptions from others.

We need natural acceptance because once we fully and truly commit ourselves based on natural acceptance, we feel a holistic sense of inner harmony, tranquility, and fulfillment. It enables us to understand 'what is valuable ' for human happiness, helps us understand our needs and visualize our goals correctly and also helps to remove our conconfusiond contradictions, and brings harmony at all levels.

We can achieve natural acceptance if we don't consider the factors such as peer pressure, thinking of others' judgment, etc .
