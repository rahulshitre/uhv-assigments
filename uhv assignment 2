We knew that several bad habits affect our healthy lifestyle. 
These habits can cause much harm not only to the body but too.
In addition, these habits are also the cause of many evils in society. The major healthy lifestyle destroying habits are smoking, drinking, junk food, addiction, meal skipping, and overuse of pills.
